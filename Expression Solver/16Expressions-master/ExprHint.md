# Expression Solver Algorithm

while there are * and /  symbols
{
>     find the 1st * or / operator 
>     get the first operand
>     get the second operand
>     get the operator
>     calc the answer
>     remove the first operand
>     remove the operator
>     replace the 2nd operand with the new answer   

}
