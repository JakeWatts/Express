# Expression Solver

Take an expression and solve it.  For instance, if you were given 3 + 4 * 5, you should come to the answer of 23.  This would require that you handle the multiplication before the addition.

### Sample Data:

```
3 + 5
3 / 5
5 / 5 * 2 + 8 / 2 + 5
```

										
### Sample Output:

```
3 + 5 = 8
3 / 5 = 0
5 / 5 * 2 + 8 / 2 + 5 = 11
```
